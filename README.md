I'm **Srijoni Chakraborty**, a fourth-year B.Tech student majoring in Information Technology at MCKV Institute of Engineering. I am passionate about learning and growing in the tech field, especially in Web Development and Data Analytics.

As a beginner, I am eager to expand my skills and knowledge in software development, and I enjoy tackling challenges that allow me to learn and adapt. I am currently exploring various technologies like Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, and NodeJS.

I believe in continuous learning and am always looking for opportunities to improve myself. Feel free to check out my projects and connect with me!
